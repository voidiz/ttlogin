Automatically perform matrix authentication when logging into the Tokyo Tech portal. Currently only for Chrome (and other Chromium-based browsers?).

## Usage
1. Download the latest .zip file from the [releases page](https://github.com/voidiz/ttlogin/releases) and unzip it.
2. Go to `chrome://extensions` and turn on developer mode (toggle in the top left corner).
3. Click "Load unpacked" and select the unzipped folder.
4. Open the extension from the browser toolbar and fill in your matrix values.
5. Log in as usual.
